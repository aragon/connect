_Aragon Connect is still in active development and its API might change until it reaches 1.0._

## Usage

```javascript
// Connects to an organization.
const org = await connect('org.aragonid.eth', 'thegraph')

// Intents can be converted in a transaction.
const intent = await org.removeApp('0xâ€¦')

// Get the transactions for the intent with the current account
const transactions = await intent.transactions(wallet.address)

// Sign the generated transactions
for (const transaction of transactions) {
  await ethers.sendTransaction(transaction.toEthers())
}
```
