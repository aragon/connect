# Intent

An TransactionIntent to create an Ethereum transaction on, or through, an Aragon organization or its apps. It allows to retrieve transaction paths or a set of transactions to sign.

## Methods

### TransactionIntent\#paths\(account, options\)

Get all the possible transaction paths for a given address. This can be useful to let users pick the one they want. Otherwise, `TransactionIntent#transactions()` can get called directly.

| Name | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `account` | `String` | The account that will sign the transaction. |
| `options` | `Object` | Options object. |
| `options.as` | `String` | Address of an Aragon organization, or its agent app, through which the paths should get created. |
| `options.path` | `String[]` | An array of address that conform a transaction path, it will be verified without calculating other paths. |
| returns | `Promise<TransactionPath[]>` | Array of all the possible transaction paths. |

### TransactionIntent\#transactions\(account, options\)

Get the transactions to execute for the shortest transaction path.

This is an easier way to do `TransactionIntent.paths(account, options)[0].transactions`

| Name | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `account` | `String` | The account that will sign the transaction. |
| `options` | `Object` | Options object. |
| `options.as` | `String` | Address of an Aragon organization, or its agent app, through which the paths should get created. |
| `options.path` | `String[]` | An array of address that conform a transaction path, it will be verified without calculating other paths. |
| returns | `Promise<TransactionRequest[]>` | The transactions corresponding to the shortest transaction path. |
