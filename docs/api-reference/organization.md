# Organization

An `Organization` instance represents an Aragon organization and exposes methods to interact with it.

## Methods

### Organization\#app\(appFilter\)

Fetch a specific app from the organization.

| Name | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `appFilter` | `String` or object \(optional\) | When a string is passed, the app will get searched by address if it starts by `0x`, and by `appName` otherwise. See `appFilter.address` and `appFilter.appName` to set them explicitly. For the time being, only one type of filter can get passed at a time. |
| `appFilter.address` | `String` | Same as `appFilter`, but makes the selection by `address` explicit. |
| `appFilter.appName` | `String` | Same as `appFilter`, but makes the selection by `appName` explicit. |
| returns | `Promise<App>` | A promise resolving to an app. |

### Organization\#onApp\(appFilter, callback\)

Like `Organization#app()`, but as a subscription.

| Name | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `appFilter` | `String` or object \(optional\) | When a string is passed, the app will get searched by address if it starts by `0x`, and by `appName` otherwise. See `appFilter.address` and `appFilter.appName` to set them explicitly. For the time being, only one type of filter can get passed at a time. |
| `appFilter.address` | `String` | Same as `appFilter`, but makes the selection by `address` explicit. |
| `appFilter.appName` | `String` | Same as `appFilter`, but makes the selection by `appName` explicit. |
| `callback` | `app => void` | A callback that will get called every time the result gets updated. |
| returns | `{ unsubscribe: Function }` | A handler that allows to stop receiving updates. |

### Organization\#apps\(appFilter\)

Fetch apps from the organization.

| Name | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `appFilter` | `String` or `String[]` or object \(optional\) | When a string is passed, apps will get filtered by address if it starts by `0x`, and by `appName` otherwise. When an array is passed, the first entry determines the type of filter. See `appFilter.address` and `appFilter.appName` to set them explicitly. For the time being, only one type of filter can get passed at a time. |
| `appFilter.address` | `String` or `String[]` | Same as `appFilter`, but makes the selection by `address` explicit. |
| `appFilter.appName` | `String` or `String[]` | Same as `appFilter`, but makes the selection by `appName` explicit. |
| returns | `Promise<App[]>` | A promise resolving to the current list of apps. |

### Organization\#onApps\(appFilter, callback\)

Like `Organization#apps()`, but as a subscription.

| Name | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `appFilter` | `String` or `String[]` or object \(optional\) | When a string is passed, apps will get filtered by address if it starts by `0x`, and by `appName` otherwise.

For the time being, only one type of filter can get passed at a time. |
| `appFilter.address` | `String` or `String[]` | Same as `appFilter`, but makes the selection by `address` explicit. |
