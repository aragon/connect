# Custom subgraph queries

The data that the subgraphs have can be used to answer more complex questions; However, you'll need a more complex query. The available connectors create a simplified abstraction over the data, implementing a subset of queries that can cover most of the generic use cases.

## Subgraph schemas

Understanding the subgraph's schema we are going to fetch data from is key so we can ask the right questions. In the [Connectors Reference](https://github.com/aragon/connect/tree/b37f23401732b2bb3a99c5d01a3bee5c0402f01c/docs/connectors/organization.md) section you can find the schema for each subgraph associated with its particular connector.

## Creating a custom query

You can create custom queries to exploit the full power of the data contained in the subgraph. Following is an example of how to do it:

```javascript
import gql from 'graphql-tag'
import { GraphQLWrapper } from '@aragon/connect-thegraph'

// Construct the query
const QUERY = gql`
query {
  votes(where:{
    appAddress: "${VOTING_APP_ADDRESS}"
  }) {
    id
    metadata
    creator
  }
}
`

// Create the GraphQL wrapper using the specific subgraph URL
const wrapper = new GraphQLWrapper(VOTING_SUBGRAPH_URL)

// Fetch the data performing the custom query
const results = await wrapper.performQuery(QUERY)

const { votes } = results.data
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
We use `gql` a JavaScript template literal tag that parses GraphQL query strings into the standard GraphQL AST.
{% endhint %}

## Subscriptions

It is also possible to create custom queries for subscriptions:

```javascript
import gql from 'graphql-tag'
import { GraphQLWrapper } from '@aragon/connect-thegraph'

// Construct the query
const QUERY = gql`
query miniMeToken($id: String!, $address: String!) {
  miniMeToken(id: $id){
    id
    totalSupply
    holders(where: {address: $address}){
      address
      balance
    }
  }
}
`

// Create the GraphQL wrapper using the specific subgraph URL
const wrapper = new GraphQLWrapper(TOKEN_MANAGER_SUBGRAPH)

// Subscribe to receive data updates using a custom query
const subscription = wrapper.subscribeToQuery(
  QUERY,
  {
    id: TOKEN_ID,
    address: ACCOUNT_ADDRES,
  },
  results => {
    // Handle the results after every new data update
    const { miniMeToken } = results.data
  }
)

// Stop receiving updates
subscription.unsubscribe()
```
