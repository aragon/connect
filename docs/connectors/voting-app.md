# Voting app

This is an app connector for the Voting app (`voting.aragonpm.eth`). It only supports The Graph for now.

## Usage

To connect an app, you need to pass a voting app as a first parameter of the connectVoting() function:

```js
import connect from '@aragon/connect'
import connectVoting from '@aragon/connect-voting'

const org = connect('myorg.aragonid.eth', 'thegraph')
const voting = connectVoting(org.app('voting'))
```

It extends the `App` object, which means that every method and properties of [`App`](../api-reference/app.md) are also available on this object.

## Voting

An object representing the Voting app, returned by `connectVoting()`. Use the following API to retrieve its data:

### Voting\#votes\(filters\)
